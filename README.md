Server Response Time Compare

# What is it

Simple tool to compare response times between two servers.

# Use case

If you need to check two servers and compare response times, this tool is for you. Also would work great to check two different versions of the same server.

Let's say you have two AWS lambdas and you want to determine how much memory it should use. With this tool you will be able to test both lambdas until you hit diminishing returns and choose the one that is the most cost effective.
